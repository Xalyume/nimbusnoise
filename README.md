## Welcome to Nimbus Noise.
Nimbus Noise is a full stack application developed using a React frontend and Postgres through Flask Alchemy on the backend.
Nimbus Noise allows users to sign up, add albums, add songs to those albums, and listen to those songs.
In addition, users are also able to navigate to other user's songs and listen/leave comments as well.

## Technology Used:
In additional to the tech stack mentioned above, Nimbus Noise utilized AWS for users to directly upload MP3 files from this computer.
A npm package, called react-audio-player, is also used to provide a simple audio player to allow users to listen to the songs.

## Pipeline for Future Featuers:
I would like to have a search bar implemented to allow visitors to the page to specifically search for certain users.
In addition, after replacing the currently implemented Users component with the Search Bar, a component to render all current songs on the site will instead be used.
Additional information for the user, such as a bio and profile picture, will also be implemented at some point.
